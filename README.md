# swa-bb-stageconv
A broken tool to convert Sonic Unleashed (2008) levels to Sonic Generations (2011)

This would've been better if it had the actual source code for the tools it uses integrated into the program itself, but what it does is it calls some tools at the right time, and modifies XMLs from the # archives to generate a stage that can load up in Generations
